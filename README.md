# Bubble Sort

This Ruby project implements the classic **Bubble Sort** algorithm from scratch - no using `.sort` allowed....

---

## Assignment

Implement a method `#bubble_sort` that takes an array of numbers and returns a sorted array using the 
bubble sort methodology.

---

## What is Bubble Sort?

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent
elements, and **swaps them if they're in the wrong order**. The process is repeated until the array is sorted.

It's called "bubble" sort because **larger elements bubble to the end** of the array with each pass.

## Features

- Fully custom bubble sort implementation
- Sorts arrays of any numeric values
- Handles duplicate values
- Simple and beginner-friendly logic

---

## Example
```ruby
bubble_sort([4, 3, 78, 2, 0, 2])
# => [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 78]
```
